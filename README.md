Once I had learned the basics of using TypeScript I wanted to try my hand at an actual project instead of just doing concept exercises. This was tricky and I definitely want to take a course on TypeScript later on when I have more time as it's the best form of coding I've seen in a long time due to it's ability to avoid almost every error.
